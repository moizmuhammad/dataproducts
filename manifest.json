That version was too slow for converting large R objects to JSON\n  and is not extensible, but a very useful prototype.  It is fast for parsing.\n  This package uses methods, vectorized operations and C code and callbacks to R functions\n  for deserializing JSON objects to R. \n  Verison 0.4 of this package uses a new native parser, implements the transformation code\n  in C and allocates memory efficiently (rather than concatenating because of event driven parsing).\n  The result is a significantly faster parsing of large JSON documents.",

				"Description" : "The Rcpp package provides R functions as well as a C++ library\n which facilitate the integration of R and C++.\n\n   R data types (SEXP) are matched to C++ objects in a class hierarchy.  All R\n types are supported (vectors, functions, environment, etc ...)  and each\n type is mapped to a dedicated class. For example, numeric vectors are\n represented as instances of the Rcpp::NumericVector class, environments are\n represented as instances of Rcpp::Environment, functions are represented as\n Rcpp::Function, etc ... The \"Rcpp-introduction\" vignette provides a good\n entry point to Rcpp.\n\n   Conversion from C++ to R and back is driven by the templates Rcpp::wrap\n and Rcpp::as which are highly flexible and extensible, as documented\n in the \"Rcpp-extending\" vignette.\n\n   Rcpp also provides Rcpp modules, a framework that allows exposing\n C++ functions and classes to the R level. The \"Rcpp-modules\" vignette\n details the current set of features of Rcpp-modules.\n\n   Rcpp includes a concept called Rcpp sugar that brings many R functions\n into C++. Sugar takes advantage of lazy evaluation and expression templates\n to achieve great performance while exposing a syntax that is much nicer\n to use than the equivalent low-level loop code. The \"Rcpp-sugar\" vignette\n gives an overview of the feature.\n\n   Rcpp attributes provide a high-level syntax for declaring C++\n functions as callable from R and automatically generating the code\n required to invoke them.  Attributes are intended to facilitate both\n interactive use of C++ within R sessions as well as to support R\n package development. Attributes are built on top of Rcpp modules and\n their implementation is based on previous work in the inline package.\n\n   Many examples are included, and around 900 unit tests in 446 unit\n test functions provide additional usage examples.\n\n   An earlier version of Rcpp, containing what we now call the 'classic Rcpp\n API' was written during 2005 and 2006 by Dominick Samperi.  This code has\n been factored out of Rcpp into the package RcppClassic, and it is still\n available for code relying on the older interface. New development should\n always use this Rcpp package instead.\n\n   Additional documentation is available via the paper by Eddelbuettel and\n Francois (2011, JSS) paper and the book by Eddelbuettel (2013, Springer);\n see 'citation(\"Rcpp\")' for details.",
